    "Once you get the score for `X_test`, it's tempting to try to improve even more. If you got a much worse performance than for `X_train`, chances are that you're overfitting, so you need to refine your CV strategy, use regularization, or choose parameters that don't drive to that (for example, don't let a tree grow without limit!).\n",

The catch is that you already know what the exam is (you saw `X_test`), and you also got your marks (the `score`), so it's not taking another similar exam (as would happen in real life), but taking the same exam again. Strictly speaking, this is another subtle form of data leakage, but a widely used one. The hope is that by refining the training strategy, even if we're cheating a bit, the behavior of the final model when it actually takes another, different exam (that is, when it's put into production), will be better than our current one would have obtained.\n",
