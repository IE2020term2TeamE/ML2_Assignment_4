    "\n",
    "Now that we have all columns (= features or attributes) needed, it's time to remove rows (= car ads in this case) that we don't want to include. Unfortunately, **scikit-learn doesn't support transformations that remove rows** (there's an <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3855\">open issue</a> about this), so **any row-removing operations must be done as preprocessing steps that cannot be included in a Pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know from previous assignments that there're several reasons for which we may want to delete some rows. The most important ones are:\n",
    "* <u>Missing values</u>: there's some feature that has a *NaN/None* value, and we know that:\n",
    "    * <u>The feature is difficult to impute with the rest of information at hand</u> (so we don't know how to replace it with a non-missing value).\n",
    "    * <u>The fact that it's missing isn't relevant for prediction</u> (that is, if we keep it with a NaN value, the model doesn't take that fact into consideration). Note that this only applies to categorical features (as they can be encoded keeping NaNs), but not to numerical ones. **Numerical features cannot be NaN in sklearn models, except for very limited cases**.\n",
    "* <u>Outliers</u>: some value of some feature (or belonging to the target `Y`) isn't missing, but it's wrong, out of bounds, or simply doesn't make sense from the business point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: once you've decided what rows to remove and with what logic, try to write a function that, given a dataset `X`, returns that same dataset without the rows that meet that logic. Why? Because you'll have to apply this function eventually to `X_test` before predicting for it (see Step 7 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**REMARK**: why don't we remove problematic rows before splitting into training and testing? Because **that's a subtle form of data leakage**. We simply don't know what will come in `X_test` (actually we do, but we have to behave as if we didn't know!), so we need to infer from `X_train` what is \"problematic\" or an \"outlier\" and what is not. **Note that in previous assignments we cheated a bit because we used the whole dataset to discard prices that are extreme, but now we should do things properly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start here with removing the missing values for the numerical variables which are the year and the odometer. We decided to drop the missing the values because both features cannot be imputed from other features. "

This loop calls CV search, picks its `best_estimator_` and compares its performance with the best performance you had so far. If the new one is better than your current best, this becomes your new best.\n",

If you got a much worse performance than for `X_train`, chances are that you're overfitting, so you need to refine your CV strategy, use regularization, or choose parameters that don't drive to that (for example, don't let a tree grow without limit!).\n",

The catch is that you already know what the exam is (you saw `X_test`), and you also got your marks (the `score`), so it's not taking another similar exam (as would happen in real life), but taking the same exam again. Strictly speaking, this is another subtle form of data leakage, but a widely used one. The hope is that by refining the training strategy, even if we're cheating a bit, the behavior of the final model when it actually takes another, different exam (that is, when it's put into production), will be better than our current one would have obtained.\n",
