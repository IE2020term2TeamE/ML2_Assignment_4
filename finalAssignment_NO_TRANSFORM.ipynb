Remove problematic rows in X_train\n\nNow that we have all columns (= features or attributes) needed, it's time to remove rows (= car ads in this case) that we don't want to include. Unfortunately, **scikit-learn doesn't support transformations that remove rows** (there's an <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3855\">open issue</a> about this), so **any row-removing operations must be done as preprocessing steps that cannot be included in a Pipeline**.\n\nYou know from previous assignments that there're several reasons for which we may want to delete some rows. The most important ones are:\n* <u>Missing values</u>: there's some feature that has a *NaN/None* value, and we know that:\n    * <u>The feature is difficult to impute with the rest of information at hand</u> (so we don't know how to replace it with a non-missing value).\n    * <u>The fact that it's missing isn't relevant for prediction</u> (that is, if we keep it with a NaN value, the model doesn't take that fact into consideration). Note that this only applies to categorical features (as they can be encoded keeping NaNs), but not to numerical ones. **Numerical features cannot be NaN in sklearn models, except for very limited cases**.\n* <u>Outliers</u>: some value of some feature (or belonging to the target `Y`) isn't missing, but it's wrong, out of bounds, or simply doesn't make sense from the business point of view.\n\n**HINT**: once you've decided what rows to remove and with what logic, try to write a function that, given a dataset `X`, returns that same dataset without the rows that meet that logic. Why? Because you'll have to apply this function eventually to `X_test` before predicting for it (see Step 7 below).\n\n**REMARK**: why don't we remove problematic rows before splitting into training and testing? Because **that's a subtle form of data leakage**. We simply don't know what will come in `X_test` (actually we do, but we have to behave as if we didn't know!), so we need to infer from `X_train` what is \"problematic\" or an \"outlier\" and what is not. **Note that in previous assignments we cheated a bit because we used the whole dataset to discard prices that are extreme, but now we should do things properly.**\n\nWe will start here with removing the missing values for the numerical variables which are the year and the odometer.

Consider all the features you loaded in point 1, and what you've done so far regarding missing values. **You need to take into consideration these facts**:\n* <u>Numerical features cannot have missing values</u>.\n* <u>Unless you use some particular models (e.g., trees), numerical features need to be scaled</u>. **This is particularly important if in step 5 you're using a linear model, or a non-linear model that relies on scalar products** (e.g., SVMs on Neural Networks).\n* <u>All non-numerical features must be transformed into numbers</u>, so:\n    * <u>Categorical features should be one-hot encoded</u> (perhaps with NaNs, perhaps without them).\n    * <u>Ordinal features should be categorized and then one-hot encoded, or transformed into numbers somehow</u>.\n    * <u>Text features should be tf-idf vectorized</u> (if you use them, and unless you use some more advanced NLP packages).\n    * <u>Geographical features are tricky</u>. If numerical (such as coordinates), those numbers can only lie in particular ranges. If categorical, usually they follow a hierarchy (for examples regions include states, which include counties).

Depending on what you do, it's possible that some of those kind-specific transformations need to be compound too (i.e., not just single transformers but `Pipelines`, `FeatureUnions` or `ColumnTransformers`). Remember about recursion!\n\n**HINT**: if you're doing things which aren't included in scikit-learn, such as imputing missing values with some more elaborate logic than replacing by mean or mode (so that `SimpleImputer` isn't enough), you can also **write your own transformers**.

Train models\n\nData are now in a suitable way for any model we want to train. Missing values have been dropped or filled, there're no outliers, numbers have been scaled, etc. Try to keep in mind lessons learnt in ML1 and ML2, as to which models may be more suitable for this problem, slower/faster to train, etc.\n\nAlso **decide on what metric to use to measure performance**; the one you feel more comfortable with, whatever. In any case, follow this motto: \"start simple, and then add complexity little by little\". The usual procedure is:\n1. <u>Start with a really simple model</u>, perhaps even a `DummyRegressor` (or `DummyClassifier` if this was a classification problem). Such a simple model is very fast to train, and it gives you **a value of the error metric that you must improve. If you do worse than this, you're making some mistake in your pipeline**.\n2. Once you've that reference dummy performance, <u>turn linear</u>. Use simple linear models, and see where you can get. **The new error should be better than the dummy one, but probably still not very satisfactory**. In any case, **this becomes the new reference to beat**.\n3. Once you've the reference linear performance, <u>turn non-linear, but interpretable</u>. This is where trees, nearest neighbors or naïve bayes come in handy, as they're easily intepreted (if-then rules, using very similar samples, or using independent probabilities). **Most likely you'll get an error which is even better than linear one, so this becomes the new reference**.\n4. <u>Turn non-linear and non-interpretable</u>. Typically here we use models like SVMs or Neural Networks, which are even more powerful, but harder to train and particularly difficult to explain in simple words.\n5. If not even all of this is enough, <u>build ensembles</u>. That is, not relying on a single model, but combining what several models say.\n\n**HINT**: build a `Pipeline` with the previous preprocessing transformations, and whose final step is the model you want to try. This ensures that transformations are applied before training.\n\n**HINT**: use `GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV` to not only try the default model, but also tune its more important hyperparameters. Remember that a `Pipeline` is an estimator, so that's what you feed into the search.
