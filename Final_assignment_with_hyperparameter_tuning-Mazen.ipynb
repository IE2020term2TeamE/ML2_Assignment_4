Missing values have been dropped or filled, there're no outliers, numbers have been scaled, etc. Try to keep in mind lessons learnt in ML1 and ML2, as to which models may be more suitable for this problem, slower/faster to train, etc.\n",

    "Also **decide on what metric to use to measure performance**; the one you feel more comfortable with, whatever. In any case, follow this motto: \"start simple, and then add complexity little by little\". The usual procedure is:\n",
    "1. <u>Start with a really simple model</u>, perhaps even a `DummyRegressor` (or `DummyClassifier` if this was a classification problem). Such a simple model is very fast to train, and it gives you **a value of the error metric that you must improve. If you do worse than this, you're making some mistake in your pipeline**.\n",
    "2. Once you've that reference dummy performance, <u>turn linear</u>. Use simple linear models, and see where you can get. **The new error should be better than the dummy one, but probably still not very satisfactory**. In any case, **this becomes the new reference to beat**.\n",
    "3. Once you've the reference linear performance, <u>turn non-linear, but interpretable</u>. This is where trees, nearest neighbors or naïve bayes come in handy, as they're easily intepreted (if-then rules, using very similar samples, or using independent probabilities). **Most likely you'll get an error which is even better than linear one, so this becomes the new reference**.\n",
    "4. <u>Turn non-linear and non-interpretable</u>. Typically here we use models like SVMs or Neural Networks, which are even more powerful, but harder to train and particularly difficult to explain in simple words.\n",
    "5. If not even all of this is enough, <u>build ensembles</u>. That is, not relying on a single model, but combining what several models say.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: build a `Pipeline` with the previous preprocessing transformations, and whose final step is the model you want to try. This ensures that transformations are applied before training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: use `GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV` to not only try the default model, but also tune its more important hyperparameters. Remember that a `Pipeline` is an estimator, so that's what you feed into the search. Also, remember the double underscore trick to specify that a parameter belongs to the estimator, and also recall the different CV strategies. **If you don't do CV, you'll most likely end up overfitting.**"

    "Once you get the score for `X_test`, it's tempting to try to improve even more. If you got a much worse performance than for `X_train`, chances are that you're overfitting, so you need to refine your CV strategy, use regularization, or choose parameters that don't drive to that (for example, don't let a tree grow without limit!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like when you fail an exam, and you want to have another try. The catch is that you already know what the exam is (you saw `X_test`), and you also got your marks (the `score`), so it's not taking another similar exam (as would happen in real life), but taking the same exam again. Strictly speaking, this is another subtle form of data leakage, but a widely used one. The hope is that by refining the training strategy, even if we're cheating a bit, the behavior of the final model when it actually takes another, different exam (that is, when it's put into production), will be better than our current one would have obtained.\n",

    "**HINT**: besides the score, you can also plot your predictions against reality, and try to infer when you predict wrongly. This can give you insights on how to improve the model and/or the pre-processing part."
