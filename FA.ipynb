    "Now that we have all columns (= features or attributes) needed, it's time to remove rows (= car ads in this case) that we don't want to include. Unfortunately, **scikit-learn doesn't support transformations that remove rows** (there's an <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3855\">open issue</a> about this), so **any row-removing operations must be done as preprocessing steps that cannot be included in a Pipeline**.\n",

    "    * <u>The feature is difficult to impute with the rest of information at hand</u> (so we don't know how to replace it with a non-missing value).\n",
    "    * <u>The fact that it's missing isn't relevant for prediction</u> (that is, if we keep it with a NaN value, the model doesn't take that fact into consideration). Note that this only applies to categorical features (as they can be encoded keeping NaNs), but not to numerical ones. **Numerical features cannot be NaN in sklearn models, except for very limited cases**.\n",
    "* <u>Outliers</u>: some value of some feature (or belonging to the target `Y`) isn't missing, but it's wrong, out of bounds, or simply doesn't make sense from the business point of view.\n",

    "**HINT**: once you've decided what rows to remove and with what logic, try to write a function that, given a dataset `X`, returns that same dataset without the rows that meet that logic. Why? Because you'll have to apply this function eventually to `X_test` before predicting for it (see Step 7 below).\n",

We simply don't know what will come in `X_test` (actually we do, but we have to behave as if we didn't know!), so we need to infer from `X_train` what is \"problematic\" or an \"outlier\" and what is not. **Note that in previous assignments we cheated a bit because we used the whole dataset to discard prices that are extreme, but now we should do things properly.**\n",

    "* <u>If you need to discard some feature because it's used at this step but not anymore, drop it now.</u> For example, if you use `model` to impute missing values in other features, but you don't want to use it for training because it has too many categories.\n",

    "**HINT**: once you've thought about it, try to condense this into a `ColumnTransformer` that splits processing between different kinds of features. Depending on what you do, it's possible that some of those kind-specific transformations need to be compound too (i.e., not just single transformers but `Pipelines`, `FeatureUnions` or `ColumnTransformers`). Remember about recursion!\n",

    "**HINT**: if you're doing things which aren't included in scikit-learn, such as imputing missing values with some more elaborate logic than replacing by mean or mode (so that `SimpleImputer` isn't enough), you can also **write your own transformers**. To do this, you'll need to write a class that inherits from `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` and implement yourself the `fit(X)` and the `transform(X)` methods."

    "Also **decide on what metric to use to measure performance**; the one you feel more comfortable with, whatever. In any case, follow this motto: \"start simple, and then add complexity little by little\". The usual procedure is:\n",
    "1. <u>Start with a really simple model</u>, perhaps even a `DummyRegressor` (or `DummyClassifier` if this was a classification problem). Such a simple model is very fast to train, and it gives you **a value of the error metric that you must improve. If you do worse than this, you're making some mistake in your pipeline**.\n",
    "2. Once you've that reference dummy performance, <u>turn linear</u>. Use simple linear models, and see where you can get. **The new error should be better than the dummy one, but probably still not very satisfactory**. In any case, **this becomes the new reference to beat**.\n",
    "3. Once you've the reference linear performance, <u>turn non-linear, but interpretable</u>. This is where trees, nearest neighbors or naïve bayes come in handy, as they're easily intepreted (if-then rules, using very similar samples, or using independent probabilities). **Most likely you'll get an error which is even better than linear one, so this becomes the new reference**.\n",
    "4. <u>Turn non-linear and non-interpretable</u>. Typically here we use models like SVMs or Neural Networks, which are even more powerful, but harder to train and particularly difficult to explain in simple words.\n",
    "5. If not even all of this is enough, <u>build ensembles</u>. That is, not relying on a single model, but combining what several models say.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: build a `Pipeline` with the previous preprocessing transformations, and whose final step is the model you want to try. This ensures that transformations are applied before training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: use `GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV` to not only try the default model, but also tune its more important hyperparameters. Remember that a `Pipeline` is an estimator, so that's what you feed into the search. Also, remember the double underscore trick to specify that a parameter belongs to the estimator, and also recall the different CV strategies. **If you don't do CV, you'll most likely end up overfitting.**"

If you got a much worse performance than for `X_train`, chances are that you're overfitting, so you need to refine your CV strategy, use regularization, or choose parameters that don't drive to that (for example, don't let a tree grow without limit!).\n",

The catch is that you already know what the exam is (you saw `X_test`), and you also got your marks (the `score`), so it's not taking another similar exam (as would happen in real life), but taking the same exam again. Strictly speaking, this is another subtle form of data leakage, but a widely used one. The hope is that by refining the training strategy, even if we're cheating a bit, the behavior of the final model when it actually takes another, different exam (that is, when it's put into production), will be better than our current one would have obtained.\n",
